# Terraform deployments for NetApp's GenAI Toolkit
This repository hosts Terraform deployment scripts to deploy the NetApp GenAI toolkit. See READMEs in the specific cloud provider directories for more information. 

To get the GenAI toolkit up and running, please follow the instructions specific to your chosen cloud provider. For more detailed information, refer to the link below.

Once the GenAI toolkit is up and running, you will need to add your API key to your user account after creating it. Therefore, a prerequisite for using the service is having access to the API key for the AI model you intend to use. If you intend to use an Azure OpenAI key, please note that you need to apply for access, which may take up to 24 hours to be granted.

If you encounter any issues with getting the GenAI toolkit up and running or configuring the AI models, please send an email to hinrik@netapp.com.
